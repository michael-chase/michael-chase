### Salutations, traveler.

I'm an indie game developer. I'm currently working on Alpha Mono S, a modern take on oldschool space schmups (shoot 'em ups) using [kaboom.js](https://github.com/replit/kaboom)ðŸ’¥. I'm still learning kaboom and diving deeper into modern JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript. I'd love to work with artists, musicians, and other game designers on future projects. Get in touch with me on Twitter [@FlashMcAllister](https://twitter.com/FlashMcAllister). Fun fact: You can tell the difference between flying ants and termites by the width of their waist.
